While no comprehensive congestion pricing schemes exist in Australia, the tolls on Sydney Harbour Bridge have some of the characteristics of a congestion charge -- tolls vary by time of day and day of week. And as noted above, the NSW and Victorian governments also place a parking levy on inner city car parks -- while not dynamically charging based on changing road conditions, this still acts as proxy congestion charge on commuters to the inner city.
