\begin{overview}
Within living memory, Australia was a place where housing costs were manageable, and people of all ages and incomes had a reasonable chance to own a home with good access to jobs.
But home ownership rates are falling among all Australians younger than 65, especially those with lower incomes.
Owning a home increasingly depends on who your parents are, a big change from 35 years ago when home ownership rates were high for all levels of income.
Those on low incomes – increasingly renters – are spending more of their income on housing.

Cities are not delivering the best mix of housing location and density given what people would prefer.
It's getting harder for people to find housing close to the job that suits them best. 
Major cities are increasingly geographically divided, so that young people with less income and education are concentrated on the fringes of capital cities.

It's been a perfect storm of rising incomes and falling interest rates, rapid migration, tax and welfare settings feeding demand, and planning rules restricting supply.
As a result, house prices more than doubled in real terms over the past 20 years. The strains are most acute in Sydney and Melbourne.
Since 2012, house prices have risen 50 per cent in Melbourne, and 70 per cent in Sydney.

Development in middle suburbs has increased in recent years, especially in Sydney.
But today’s record level of housing construction is the bare minimum needed to meet record levels of population growth driven by rapid migration.
Meanwhile a decade of accumulated shortages are forcing younger people to set up their own homes later in life.

Building an extra 50,000 homes a year for a decade could leave Australian house prices 
5 to 20 per cent lower than what they would have been otherwise, and stem rising public anxiety about housing affordability.
For that to happen, both State and Commonwealth governments must act.

To build more homes, State governments should fix planning rules to allow more homes to be built in inner and middle-ring suburbs of our largest cities.
More small-scale urban infill projects should be allowed without council planning approval. 
State governments should also allow denser development `as of right' along key transport corridors.
They should swap stamp duties for general property taxes.
And state land taxes on investment property should be flat rate with no tax-free threshold, to encourage more institutional investors likely to provide longer-term tenancies.

The Commonwealth Government can improve housing affordability somewhat – and immediately – by reducing demand.
It should reduce the capital gains tax discount to 25 per cent; abolish negative gearing; and include owner-occupied housing in the Age Pension assets test.
And unless the states are prepared to reform their planning systems, the Commonwealth should consider tapping the brakes on Australia’s migrant intake.

It took neglectful governments two decades to create the current housing affordability mess.
They preferred the easy choices that merely appear to address the problem.
The politics of reform are fraught because most voters own a home or an investment property, and mistrust any change that might dent the price of their assets.
But if governments keep pretending there are easy answers, housing affordability will just get worse.
Older people will not be able to downsize in the suburb where they live, and our children won’t be able to buy their own home.

\addchap{Recommendations}
\raggedbottom

% \begin{Center}
\section*{Governments should reduce the demand for housing}
% \end{Center}

\subsubsection{1. The Commonwealth Government should limit negative gearing and reduce the capital gains tax discount}
\begin{itemize}
\item  Phase in a 25 per cent discount over five years by reducing the value of the CGT discount by 5 percentage points each year.
\item Limit negative gearing by quarantining wage and salary income so that investment losses can only be written off against other investment income.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{2. The Commonwealth Government should include more of the value of high priced homes in the Age Pension assets test}
\begin{itemize}
\item Change the Age Pension assets test to include the value of a home above some threshold – such as \$500,000.
\item Correspondingly, raise the value of assets that do not reduce the Age Pension to the same levels that applies to non-homeowners.
\item Extend the Pension Loans Scheme so that people disqualified from the Age Pension by their assets can borrow income up to the rate of the Age Pension against the security of their home. 
\end{itemize}
\vfill\null
\eject
\null
\vspace*{-0.6\baselineskip}
\subsubsection{3. State governments should broaden land taxes to include owner-occupied housing}
\begin{itemize}
\item Extend state land taxes to owner occupied housing.
\item Alternatively, impose an additional uniform \$2 levy for every \$1,000 of unimproved land value used for owner-occupied housing as recommended in Grattan Institute's 2015 report, \textit{Property Taxes}. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{4. The Commonwealth Government should enforce laws covering foreign investment in residential real estate}
\begin{itemize}
\item Enforce properly the existing limits on foreign investors buying established housing.  
\item Continue to raise revenue from foreign investors, but do not increase taxes by so much that foreign investment falls substantially.
\item Encourage foreign (and domestic) investors to rent out their investment properties.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{5. The Commonwealth Government should develop an explicit population policy}
\begin{itemize}
\item Develop a population policy, which articulates the appropriate level of migration given evidence of the impact of migration on the well-being of the Australian community, accounting for both actual and optimal infrastructure and land use planning policies. 
\item If planning and infrastructure policies do not improve, consider reducing Australia's current migrant intake.  
\end{itemize}

% \end{recommendations}

% \begin{recommendationsContd}
\pagebreak
\section*{Governments should improve the supply of housing}
\subsubsection{6. Governments should encourage greater density in inner and middle ring suburbs}
\begin{itemize}
\item All levels of government should build the public case for increased density. 
\item State and local governments should change planning processes to allow more medium-density housing in established suburbs that are close to jobs and transport.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fewer small-scale urban infill projects should not require development approvals and should instead be code-assessed.
    \item More dense development should be allowed `as of right' along key transport corridors, with height limits set up front.
\end{itemize}
\item The Commonwealth Government should provide incentives to the States to encourage them to revise planning and other policies to permit greater density and increase housing supply.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{7. State governments should set housing targets and make sure local governments meet them}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use carrots and sticks to ensure councils meet housing targets that align with long-term city plans.
\item Give independent planning panels responsibility for assessing development applications where local councils fail to meet housing targets, .
\end{itemize}
\eject
\null
\vspace*{-0.6\baselineskip}  
\subsubsection{8. State governments need to release more greenfield land, particularly in Sydney}
\begin{itemize}
\item Maintain a long-term supply of new greenfield land for residential development, particularly in Sydney, notwithstanding its geographic constraints.
\item Reform infrastructure charges to align with the Productivity Commission’s general principles on infrastructure costs.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{9. State and local councils should consider introducing more explicit betterment taxes to capture the windfall gains from re-zoning of land}
\begin{itemize}
\item Be explicit when aiming to capture a share of windfall profits from rezoning or planning gain
\item Ensure charges are reasonable and predictable.
Aim only to capture a share of the economic value added above costs and a risk-adjusted return on capital.
\end{itemize}

% \end{recommendationsContd}

% \begin{recommendationsContd}

\subsubsection{10. State governments should reform property taxes to improve housing affordability}
\begin{itemize}
\item Swap stamp duties for general property taxes
\item Reform land taxes to encourage institutional investors in rental housing, either by: flattening existing progressive state land taxes and abolishing tax-free thresholds; or switching to a progressive land tax assessed on the value of each property owned, rather than the combined value of an owner's total landholdings.
\end{itemize}

\pagebreak
\subsubsection{11. States governments should amend tenancy laws to make renting more attractive}
\begin{itemize}
\item Change tenancy laws incrementally to enable tenants to make their rental property feel like their home.
\item Change tenancy laws to increase security of tenure for renters, in combination with changes to property taxes to encourage more institutional investment in rental housing.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{12. All governments should improve transport networks to increase the effective supply of well-located housing}
\begin{itemize}
\item All governments should amend transport and financial legislation so that public money cannot be committed to a project unless Infrastructure Australia or another independent body has assessed it as high priority, and the business case has been tabled in Parliament.
\item State governments should introduce time-of-day congestion pricing in the most congested central areas of each capital city.
\end{itemize}


\section*{Institutional reforms}
\subsubsection{13. The Commonwealth Government should establish a National Housing Research Council}

\begin{itemize}
\item Establish a National Housing Research Council as an independent statutory body with a mandate to collect nationally consistent data on issues related to housing supply and demand, including data on the operation of state and local government land use planning systems, infrastructure charges and migration. 
\item Use the new body to hold the States to account if they commit to boost housing supply and reform land use planning rules as part of any deal with the Commonwealth Government. 
\end{itemize}

\eject
\section*{Policy ideas we don't recommend}
\begin{itemize}
\item Pushing jobs or people to the regions in the name of housing affordability
\item Further stamp duty concessions and other giveaways to first home-buyers
\item Shared equity schemes that are not targeted to low-income households
\item Financial incentives to encourage downsizing by seniors
\end{itemize}
